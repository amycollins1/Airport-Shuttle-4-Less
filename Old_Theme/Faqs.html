                                        Like all premium limousine services, AS4L books reservations that begin at a three-hour (3) minimum to prevent 'split reservations' - this practice is standard in order to prevent accidental booking overlap.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        A 'split reservation' occurs when a trip is booked without enough buffer time between each, and the first trip runs into difficulty, highly increasing the chances the following reservation will be negatively affected. Booking minimum time slots guarantees that each and every one of our clients receives the service they deserve and have come to expect from AS4L.

                                        Much like staying at a hotel, luxury ground travel is charged by the trip or itinerary. For example:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        You book a hotel room for one night. Although you may not spend every minute of your day and night in the room, you are still billed for one full day.<br />
                                        Similarly, if you book a vehicle for eight (8) hours but only spend four (4) hours inside the vehicle, you are still responsible for payment of the full eight (8) hours.
                                    </p>
